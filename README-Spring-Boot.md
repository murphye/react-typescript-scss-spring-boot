# Spring Boot Readme

In the past, it's been difficult to create hybrid Node/Spring projects due to restrictions with directory structure and build tools. For example, many have been forced to put the Node-based application deep into the project at src/main/resources and do other crazy things to make it work.

This project takes a different tact now that React applications have a directory structure that is more compatible with a Maven directory structure, particularly the src/ directory.
